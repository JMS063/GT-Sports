        Through the study of this semester, I have achieved the introduction of webpage production. This is the first time that I have completed a webpage independently, from design, layout to the final production of the webpage. I thought webpage creation was a very complicated thing, but later I found out that webpage creation is actually similar to module building programming, which better confirms what was said in the lecture at the beginning of the course, HTML is the framework of webpages, CSS and JavaScript are furniture, which makes the elements in HTML look better. So far, I have learned to write HTML files in the correct way, and at the same time, I can use CSS files to make my web pages look like I like. At the same time, some cool functions can be added through JS files to have stronger interaction and improve user experience. In the process of learning and experimenting, the most difficult part of making web pages for me is adapting web pages to different sized screens.

        I also learned a lot from the suggestions given to me by teachers A1 and A2. In A1, there was a suggestion on CSS files, and it was proposed that "one CSS file is enough to cover the entire web page". I agree with this point. I am in A3 In the middle, I tried to synthesize the current CSS files I have into 1-2. Another point is "for click events, add labels". This is indeed very correct. For some unobvious click events, the addition of labels will improve The sense of user experience, I will think about this in the process of writing A3.

        The understanding of HCI has also changed during the learning process. In the middle of the iteration of the webpage, user-centered is the main consideration. How to design the webpage to improve the user experience is a question I have been thinking about in the middle and late stages. I am going to provide the function of multi-platform screen adaptation. All in all, the challenge of web page production is not coding, but HCI.
