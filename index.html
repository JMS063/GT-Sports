        Me and My Passion
    </h1>
    <p id="passion">
    Hello, my name is minghao Dong and I am a third year BAC student.
    <br>
    For this web design assignment, I chose a racing car related theme. 
    <br>
    My inspiration came from a racing game called "GT-Sports". I am a car fanatic. 
    <br>
    This game has a very high degree of restoration of the car and the track.
     <br>
    The production and physical parameters of the car in the game are almost exactly 
     <br>
    the same as those in reality. At the same time, it has a highly restored track. 
     <br>
    So I decided to combine the game with reality and make a racing-themed  
    <br>
    webpage to let more people know about racing cars, tracks and events,
    <br>
    and hope that more people can know about the game "GT - Sports". 
    <br>
    My preliminary plan for this website is to include cars from all over the world 
    <br>
    and some custom-made vehicles for the competition,including real tracks, event information, teams, 
    <br>
    event sponsors,and racing pictures and videos based on games.
     <br>
    At the same time, it will also include an introduction section and a feedback section for the game. 
    <br>
    hese two sections will not be specially exhibited, and will be displayed in the form of links at the bottom of the page.
